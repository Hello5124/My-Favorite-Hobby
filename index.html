      <p> My favorite hobby is reading books. I like reading them because they are basically fun imaginary adventures in paper. I like reading fantasy books and even sometimes fact books. I like reading fantasy books because it helps my imagination grow bigger and it is also very interesting and fun to read. I usually read my books whenever I am bored or whenever it is nighttime. Reading fact books also lets me learn some amazing facts that I might've never known about if I didn't read about it. I also like reading old books that tell about old myths and legends. My favorite topic for a myth or legend is usually greek mythology. </p>
